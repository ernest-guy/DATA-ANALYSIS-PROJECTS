Are we happy as people or not?

I was intrigued by the relatively lower levels of happiness in Sub-Saharan Africa compared to other regions of the world. Is it age, the high levels of poverty or the fact that people are increasingly not marrying and divorcing that people are not so happy with their lives. I ventured onto a study of the Zimbabwe population

This personal study analyses life satisfaction and how it relates with age, wealth status and marital status.
Major studies and reports show that Sub-Saharan Africa is the region with the lowest average score of self reported life satisfaction of 4.15. Surprising results from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey Dataset show that happiness is actually linked to wealth status of individuals and wealthier people are happier. Married people also report to be happier with their lives compared to those not in union. A statistically significant relationship is found between life satisfaction and both wealth status and marital status. 
Additionally, a larger percentage of old people(35 years plus) report to be very unhappy with their lives compared to the youths(18 to 35 years) and young(less than 18 years).

The figure 1 shows people in the highest wealth quintile are mostly somewhat happy with their lives compared to people in the lowest wealth quintile who are mostly somewhat unhappy with their lives.

The figure 2 shows people who are currently married are the most very happy with their lives compared to those not in union or living with a partner.

Figure 3 shows the percentage of youths very happy with their lives(54.99%) is higher than the percentage of old(24.21%) . Conversely, the percentage of old people that are very unhappy with their lives(48.14%) is higher than that of the youth(45.41%) and young(6.45%).
